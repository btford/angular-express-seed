  <code>ngAnimate</code>
</h1>

<h1 id="nganimate">ngAnimate</h1>
<p>The <code>ngAnimate</code> module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.</p>
<div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
or to register a JavaScript animation via the myModule.animation() function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
<code>ngRepeat</code>, <code>ngInclude</code>, <code>ngIf</code>, <code>ngSwitch</code>, <code>ngShow</code>, <code>ngHide</code>, <code>ngView</code> and <code>ngClass</code>. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
by using the <code>$animate</code> service.</p>
<p>Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:</p>

<p>You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.</p>
<p>Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
.slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
  -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
  transition:0.5s linear all;
}

.slide.ng-enter { }        /* starting animations for enter */
.slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /* terminal animations for enter */
.slide.ng-leave { }        /* starting animations for leave */
.slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /* terminal animations for leave */
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;!--
the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
to trigger the CSS transition/animations
--&gt;
&lt;ANY class=&quot;slide&quot; ng-include=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/ANY&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
until the parent element&#39;s animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
placing the <code>ng-animate-children</code> attribute on a parent container tag.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div class=&quot;slide-animation&quot; ng-if=&quot;on&quot; ng-animate-children&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fade-animation&quot; ng-if=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;explode-animation&quot; ng-if=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
       ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When the <code>on</code> expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.</p>
<p><h2>CSS-defined Animations</h2>
The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
and can be used to play along with this naming structure.</p>
<p>The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using <strong>CSS transitions</strong> with Angular:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
/*
 The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
*/
.reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /* Safari/Chrome */
 transition: 1s linear all; /* All other modern browsers and IE10+ */

 /* The animation preparation code */
 opacity: 0;
}

/*
 Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 conflicts
*/
.reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 /* The animation code itself */
 opacity: 1;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;view-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div ng-view class=&quot;reveal-animation&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using <strong>CSS animations</strong> with Angular:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
.reveal-animation.ng-enter {
  -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /* Safari/Chrome */
  animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /* IE10+ and Future Browsers */
}
@-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
  from { opacity:0; }
  to { opacity:1; }
}
@keyframes enter_sequence {
  from { opacity:0; }
  to { opacity:1; }
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;view-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div ng-view class=&quot;reveal-animation&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.</p>
<p>Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like <code>ng-enter</code>), then the browser prepares itself to add
the active class (in this case <code>ng-enter-active</code>) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.</p>
<p><h3>CSS Staggering Animations</h3>
A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module, as of 1.2.0, supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
performed by creating a <strong>ng-EVENT-stagger</strong> CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a <strong>transition-delay</strong> or an
<strong>animation-delay</strong> property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.my-animation.ng-enter {
  /* standard transition code */
  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
  transition: 1s linear all;
  opacity:0;
}
.my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
  /* this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation */
  -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
  transition-delay: 0.1s;

  /* in case the stagger doesn&#39;t work then these two values
   must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance */
  -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
  transition-duration: 0s;
}
.my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
  /* standard transition styles */
  opacity:1;
}</code></pre>
<p>Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.</p>
<p>The following code will issue the <strong>ng-leave-stagger</strong> event on the element provided:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">var kids = parent.children();

$animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
$animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
$animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
$animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
$animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4

$timeout(function() {
  //stagger has reset itself
  $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
  $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
}, 100, false);</code></pre>
<p>Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.</p>
<p><h2>JavaScript-defined Animations</h2>
In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">//!annotate=&quot;YourApp&quot; Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
var ngModule = angular.module(&#39;YourApp&#39;, [&#39;ngAnimate&#39;]);
ngModule.animation(&#39;.my-crazy-animation&#39;, function() {
  return {
    enter: function(element, done) {
      //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
      return function(cancelled) {
        //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
        //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
        //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
      };
    },
    leave: function(element, done) { },
    move: function(element, done) { },

    //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
    beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },

    //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
    addClass: function(element, className, done) { },

    //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
    beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },

    //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
    removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
  };
});</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
the element&#39;s CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function will
be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).</p>
<p>Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).</p>



  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>First include <code>angular-animate.js</code> in your HTML:</p>

  <pre><code>    &lt;script src=&quot;angular.js&quot;&gt;&#10;    &lt;script src=&quot;angular-animate.js&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
