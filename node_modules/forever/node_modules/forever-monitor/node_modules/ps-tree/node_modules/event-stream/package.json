  "readme": "# EventStream\n\n[Streams](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html \"Stream\") are nodes best and most misunderstood idea, and \n_<em>EventStream</em>_ is a toolkit to make creating and working with streams <em>easy</em>.  \n\nNormally, streams are only used of IO,  \nbut in event stream we send all kinds of objects down the pipe.  \nIf your application's <em>input</em> and <em>output</em> are streams,  \nshouldn't the <em>throughput</em> be a stream too?  \n\nThe *EventStream* functions resemble the array functions,  \nbecause Streams are like Arrays, but laid out in time, rather than in memory.  \n\n<em>All the `event-stream` functions return instances of `Stream`</em>.\n\nStream API docs: [nodejs.org/api/streams](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html \"Stream\")\n\nNOTE: I shall use the term <em>\"through stream\"</em> to refer to a stream that is writable <em>and</em> readable.  \n\n###[simple example](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/blob/master/examples/pretty.js):\n\n``` js\n\n//pretty.js\n\nif(!module.parent) {\n  var es = require('event-stream')\n  es.connect(                         //connect streams together with `pipe`\n    process.openStdin(),              //open stdin\n    es.split(),                       //split stream to break on newlines\n    es.map(function (data, callback) {//turn this async function into a stream\n      callback(null\n        , inspect(JSON.parse(data)))  //render it nicely\n    }),\n    process.stdout                    // pipe it to stdout !\n    )\n  }\n```\nrun it ...\n\n``` bash  \ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | node pretty.js\n```\n \n[test are in event-stream_tests](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream_tests)\n\n[node Stream documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/streams.html)\n\n##map (asyncFunction)\n\nCreate a through stream from an asyncronous function.  \n\n``` js\nvar es = require('event-stream')\n\nes.map(function (data, callback) {\n  //transform data\n  // ...\n  callback(null, data)\n})\n\n```\n\nEach map MUST call the callback. It may callback with data, with an error or with no arguments, \n\n  * `callback()` drop this data.  \n    this makes the map work like `filter`,  \n    note:`callback(null,null)` is not the same, and will emit `null`\n\n  * `callback(null, newData)` turn data into newData\n    \n  * `callback(error)` emit an error for this item.\n\n>Note: if a callback is not called, `map` will think that it is still being processed,   \n>every call must be answered or the stream will not know when to end.  \n>\n>Also, if the callback is called more than once, every call but the first will be ignored.\n\n##readable (asyncFunction) \n\ncreate a readable stream (that respects pause) from an async function.  \nwhile the stream is not paused,  \nthe function will be polled with `(count, callback)`,  \nand `this`  will be the readable stream.\n\n``` js\n\nes.readable(function (count, callback) {\n  if(streamHasEnded)\n    return this.emit('end')\n  \n  //...\n  \n  this.emit('data', data) //use this way to emit multiple chunks per call.\n      \n  callback() // you MUST always call the callback eventually.\n             // the function will not be called again until you do this.\n})\n```\nyou can also pass the data and the error to the callback.  \nyou may only call the callback once.  \ncalling the same callback more than once will have no effect.  \n\n##readArray (array)\n\nCreate a readable stream from an Array.\n\nJust emit each item as a data event, respecting `pause` and `resume`.\n\n``` js\n  var es = require('event-stream')\n    , reader = es.readArray([1,2,3])\n\n  reader.pipe(...)\n```\n\n## writeArray (callback)\n\ncreate a writeable stream from a callback,  \nall `data` events are stored in an array, which is passed to the callback when the stream ends.\n\n``` js\n  var es = require('event-stream')\n    , reader = es.readArray([1, 2, 3])\n    , writer = es.writeArray(function (err, array){\n      //array deepEqual [1, 2, 3]\n    })\n\n  reader.pipe(writer)\n```\n\n## split ()\n\nBreak up a stream and reassemble it so that each line is a chunk.  \n\nExample, read every line in a file ...\n\n``` js\n  es.connect(\n    fs.createReadStream(file, {flags: 'r'}),\n    es.split(),\n    es.map(function (line, cb) {\n       //do something with the line \n       cb(null, line)\n    })\n  )\n\n```\n\n## connect (stream1,...,streamN)\n\nConnect multiple Streams together into one stream.  \n`connect` will return a Stream. This stream will write to the first stream,\nand will emit data from the last stream. \n\nListening for 'error' will recieve errors from all streams inside the pipe.\n\n``` js\n\n  es.connect(                         //connect streams together with `pipe`\n    process.openStdin(),              //open stdin\n    es.split(),                       //split stream to break on newlines\n    es.map(function (data, callback) {//turn this async function into a stream\n      callback(null\n        , inspect(JSON.parse(data)))  //render it nicely\n    }),\n    process.stdout                    // pipe it to stdout !\n    )\n```\n\n## gate (isShut=true) \n\nIf the gate is `shut`, buffer the stream.  \nAll calls to write will return false (pause upstream),  \nand end will not be sent downstream.  \n\nIf the gate is open, let the stream through.  \n\nNamed `shut` instead of close, because close is already kinda meaningful with streams.  \n\nGate is useful for holding off processing a stream until some resource (i.e. a database, or network connection) is ready.  \n\n``` js\n\n  var gate = es.gate()\n  \n  gate.open() //allow the gate to stream\n  \n  gate.close() //buffer the stream, also do not allow 'end' \n\n```\n\n## duplex\n\nTakes a writable stream and a readable stream and makes them appear as a readable writable stream.\n\nIt is assumed that the two streams are connected to each other in some way.  \n\n(This is used by `connect` and `child`.)\n\n``` js\n  var grep = cp.exec('grep Stream')\n\n  es.duplex(grep.stdin, grep.stdout)\n```\n\n## child (child_process)\n\nCreate a through stream from a child process ...\n\n``` js\n  var cp = require('child_process')\n\n  es.child(cp.exec('grep Stream')) // a through stream\n\n```\n\n## pipeable (streamCreatorFunction,...)\n\nThe arguments to pipable must be functions that return  \ninstances of Stream or async functions.  \n(If a function is returned, it will be turned into a Stream  \nwith `es.map`.)\n\nHere is the first example rewritten to use `pipeable`.\n\n``` js\n//examples/pretty_pipeable.js\nvar inspect = require('util').inspect\n\nif(!module.parent)\n  require('event-stream').pipeable(function () {\n    return function (data, callback) {\n      try {\n        data = JSON.parse(data)\n      } catch (err) {}              //pass non JSON straight through!\n      callback(null, inspect(data))\n      }\n    })  \n  })\n```\n\n``` bash\n\ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | node pipeable_pretty.js\n\n## or, turn the pipe into a server!\n\nnode pipeable_pretty.js --port 4646\n\ncurl -sS registry.npmjs.org/event-stream | curl -sSNT- localhost:4646\n\n```\n## compatible modules:\n\n  *
