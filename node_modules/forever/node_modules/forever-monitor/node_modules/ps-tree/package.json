If the parent terminates, however, all it's children have assigned as their new parent the init process. Thus, the children still have a parent to collect their status and execution statistics.  \n> (from \"operating system concepts\")\n\nsolution: use `ps-tree` to get all processes that a child_process may have started, so that they may all be terminated.\n\n``` js\n  var cp = require('child_process'),\n      psTree = require('ps-tree')\n    \n  var child = cp.exec(\"node -e 'while (true);'\",function () {...})\n\n  child.kill() //this will not actually kill the child it will kill the `sh` process.\n\n```\n\nwtf? it's because exec actually works like this:\n\n``` js\nfunction exec (cmd, cb) {\n  spawn('sh', ['-c', cmd])\n  ...\n}\n\n```\n\nsh starts parses the command string and starts processes, and waits for them to terminate.  \nbut exec returns a process object with the pid of the sh process.  \nbut since it is in `wait` mode killing it does not kill the children.\n\nused ps tree like this:\n\n``` js\n\n  var cp = require('child_process'),\n      psTree = require('ps-tree')\n    \n  var child = cp.exec(\"node -e 'while (true);'\",function () {...})\n\n  psTree(child.pid, function (err, children) {\n    cp.spawn('kill', ['-9'].concat(children.map(function (p) {return p.PID})))\n  })\n\n```",
