  "readme": "A `rm -rf` for node.\n\nInstall with `npm install rimraf`, or just drop rimraf.js somewhere.\n\n## API\n\n`rimraf(f, [options,] callback)`\n\nThe callback will be called with an error if there is one.  Certain\nerrors are handled for you:\n\n* `EBUSY` -  rimraf will back off a maximum of opts.maxBusyTries times\n  before giving up.\n* `EMFILE` - If too many file descriptors get opened, rimraf will\n  patiently wait until more become available.\n\n## Options\n\nThe options object is optional.  These fields are respected:\n\n* `maxBusyTries` -  The number of times to retry a file or folder in the\n  event of an `EBUSY` error.  The default is 3.\n* `gently` - If provided a `gently` path, then rimraf will only delete\n  files and folders that are beneath this path, and only delete symbolic\n  links that point to a place within this path.  (This is very important\n  to npm's use-case, and shows rimraf's pedigree.)\n\n\n## rimraf.sync\n\nIt can remove stuff synchronously, too.  But that's not so good.  Use\nthe async API.  It's better.\n",
