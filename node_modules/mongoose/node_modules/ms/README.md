Ever find yourself doing math in your head or writing `1000 * 60 * 60 â€¦`?
Don't want to add obstrusive `Number` prototype extensions to your reusable
/ distributable modules and projects?

`ms` is a tiny utility that you can leverage when your application needs to
accept a number of miliseconds as a parameter.

If a number is supplied to `ms`, it returns it immediately (e.g:
If a string that contains the number is supplied, it returns it immediately as
a number (e.g: it returns `100` for `'100'`).

However, if you pass a string with a number and a valid unit, hte number of
equivalent ms is returned.

```js
ms('1d')      // 86400000
ms('10h')     // 36000000
ms('2h')      // 7200000
ms('1m')      // 60000
ms('5ms')     // 5000
ms('100')     // '100'
ms(100)       // 100
```

## How to use

### Node

```js
require('ms')
```

### Browser

```html
<script src="ms.js"></script>
```
